title: Article in Science Advances: Flow stability for dynamic community detection
---

I am very glad to announce that the novel framework for community detection in temporal networks I have been working on with Jean-Charles Delvenne and Renaud Lambiotte has been published in [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj3063).
