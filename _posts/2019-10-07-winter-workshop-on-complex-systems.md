Together with Matteo Cinelli and Burcu Tepekule, I am organizing the [Winter Workshop on Complex Systems 2020](https://wwcs2020.github.io).

It will take place in Switzerland from January 27th to January 31st. 

The applications are open now, until October 20th.

It is a great opportunity to start new collaborations and work on interdisciplinary projects, more information at the website.
