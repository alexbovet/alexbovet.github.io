title: Opinion piece about the need for evidence-based regulation of social media platforms
---

Thanks to a collaboration with the Swiss Young Academy, I wrote an opinion piece about the need for evidence-based regulation of social media platforms that was published in two Swiss journals: [Higgs](https://www.higgs.ch/primaten-auf-facebook/51686/) (in German) and [Heidi.news](https://www.heidi.news/sciences/meme-sur-facebook-nous-restons-des-primates) (in French).
