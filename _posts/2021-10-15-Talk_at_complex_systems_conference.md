I will be giving a talk at the [10th International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications](https://complexnetworks.org/) about my work with Peter Grindrod on the structure and evolution of the UK far-right Telegram network. The conference will take place in Madrid from November 11th to December 12th 2021.
