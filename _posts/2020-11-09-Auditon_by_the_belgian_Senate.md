The Belgian Senate is preparing a report about the collaboration between the Belgian communities and the Federal authority in the [fight against fake news](https://www.senate.be/www/webdriver?MItabObj=pdf&MIcolObj=pdf&MInamObj=pdfid&MItypeObj=application/pdf&MIvalObj=117440622). In this context, I will have the pleasure to be interviewed by them on November 9th 2020 about my research on fake news.
