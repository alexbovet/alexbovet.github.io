I am very happy to announce that I will be giving a plenary talk at the [CompleNet 2021](https://complenet.weebly.com/) conference that will take place online from May 24th to May 26th.

I will present my new paper [*Flow stability for dynamic community detection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06131).
