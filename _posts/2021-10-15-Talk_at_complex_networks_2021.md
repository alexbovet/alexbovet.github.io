---

I am very happy to announce that I will be giving a talk at the [Communities in Networks](https://hocinecherifi.wixsite.com/comnets2021) satellite of the Joint Sunbelt and NetSci conference [Networks 2021](https://networks2021.net/) on July 01, 2021.

I will present my new paper [*Flow stability for dynamic community detection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06131).
