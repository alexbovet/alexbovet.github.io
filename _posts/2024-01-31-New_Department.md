title: New Department of Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning
---

I am thrilled to be joining the newly created Department of Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning ([D3ML](https://dm3l.uzh.ch/)) at the Faculty of Science of the University of Zurich.

I am joining my colleagues [Prof. Reinhard Furrer](https://user.math.uzh.ch/furrer/), [Prof. Delia Coculescu](https://www.math.uzh.ch/people?key1=2320) and [Prof. Jan Dirk Wegner](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Jan-Dirk-Wegner.html).

The new department will become a hub for data analysis and mathematical modeling within the faculty of sciences.
