title: Election to the Swiss Young Academy
---

I am extremely happy to have been elected to the [Swiss Young Academy](https://swissyoungacademy.ch/en) as one of the first 29 members. I am looking forward to working with other members in inter- and transdisciplinary projects and use this platform to foster dialogue between science and society.
