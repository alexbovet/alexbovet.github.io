title: Preprint on Multilevel Online Political Selective Exposure

We recently published a preprint of our work with Yuan Zhang, Laia Castro and Frank Essert [More than 'Left and Right': Revealing Multilevel Online Political Selective Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03828).

*Abstract*

Selective exposure, individuals' inclination to seek out information that supports their beliefs while avoiding information that contradicts them, plays an important role in the emergence of polarization. In the political domain, selective exposure is usually measured on a left-right ideology scale, ignoring finer details. Here, we combine survey and Twitter data collected during the 2022 Brazilian Presidential Election and investigate selective exposure patterns between the survey respondents and political influencers. We analyze the followship network between survey respondents and political influencers and find a multilevel community structure that reveals a hierarchical organization more complex than a simple split between left and right. Moreover, depending on the level we consider, we find different associations between network indices of exposure patterns and 189 individual attributes of the survey respondents. For example, at finer levels, the number of influencer communities a survey respondent follows is associated with several factors, such as demographics, news consumption frequency, and incivility perception. In comparison, only their political ideology is a significant factor at coarser levels. Our work demonstrates that measuring selective exposure at a single level, such as left and right, misses important information necessary to capture this phenomenon correctly.
