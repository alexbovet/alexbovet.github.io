---

Our work, with Leonardo Gutiérrez-Gómez and Jean-Charles Delvenne, on anomaly detection in networks (The method is called [MADAN](https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5409)) was featured in the [ERCIM News journal special issue on Solving Engineering Problems with Machine Learning](https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/).

The news article is called [Anomaly Detection on Networks is a Question of Context and Scale](https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en122/special/anomaly-detection-on-networks-is-a-question-of-context-and-scale).

The [ECRIM](https://www.ercim.eu/) is the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics.
