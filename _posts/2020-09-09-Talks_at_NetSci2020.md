---

I will have the pleasure to give two talks at the Network Science conference [NetSci2020](https://netsci2020.netscisociety.net/) which will be online this year.

The first talk will be on Saturday September 18th during the satellite [Machine Learning in Network Science](https://mlns20.tumblr.com/) on my work with Leonardo Gutiérrez-Gómez and Jean-Charles Delvenne on [anomaly detection in networks](https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5409).

The second talk will be during the main conference on [Friday September 25th at 13:30 CEST](https://easychair.org/smart-program/NETSCI2020/) on my work with Renaud Lambiotte and Jean-Charles Delvenne on community detection in non-stationary temporal networks.
