title: Recommender for the Peer Community in Network Science
---

I am very glad to have been appointed as a recommender for the [Peer Community in Network Science](https://networksci.peercommunityin.org/) by its Managing Board.

From the "Peer Community In website": "“Peer Community in” (PCI) is a non-profit scientific organization that aims to create specific communities of researchers reviewing and recommending, for free, unpublished preprints in their field (i.e. unpublished articles deposited on open online archives like arXiv and bioRxiv1)."

The "Peer Community In" concept works toward a more open science by increasing the transparence, independence and accessibility of the peer reviewing process.
