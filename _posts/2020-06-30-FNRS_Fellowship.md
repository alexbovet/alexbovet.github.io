title: FNRS Chargé de recherche

I am very happy to announce that I was awarded a FNRS (Belgian Science Foundation) [Chargé de recherche fellowship](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/fr/financements/chercheur-postdoc#cr) with [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be) as a host institute.

I am also lucky to be able to postpone the start of this fellowship until after my current appointment at the University of Oxford.
