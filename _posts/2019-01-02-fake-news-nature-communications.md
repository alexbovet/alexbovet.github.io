title: Nature Communications paper on the influence of fake news
---

I am happy to announce that my work on the Influence of fake news in Twitter during the 2016 US presidential election was recently published by [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07761-2).

In this work, we use network science, physics and data science methods to answer the questions of what was the importance and influence of fake news vs traditional news in Twitter during the 2016 US election, what are the different mechanisms of news diffusion in Twitter and who are the spreaders of fake and traditional news?
