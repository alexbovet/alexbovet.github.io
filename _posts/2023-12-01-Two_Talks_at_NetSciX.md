---

I am happy to anounce that we will have two talks that the [2024 NetSciX](https://netscix2024.netscisociety.org/) conference in Venice, Italy, in January.

My PhD student, Yas Asgari, will present our work on the effect of the Arab Spring on the research power dynamics (collaboration with Hongyu Zhou, Ozgur Kadir Ozer, Juven Nino Villacastin, Mimi Byun, Mary Ellen Sloane and Rezvaneh Rezapour).

My collaborator Nicola Pedreschi (University of Oxford) will present our work on Flow stability for community detection on directed networks with missing edges (collaboration with Renaud Lambiotte).
