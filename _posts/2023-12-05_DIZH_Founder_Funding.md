I very happy to annouce that our project "ClarifAI: Making the Unseen Seen with AI-assisted Propaganda Detection and Fact-Checking" has received funding from the Digitalization Initiative of the Zurich Higher Education Institutions (DIZH) Founder Call.

ClarifAI employs Large Language Models aims at fighting propaganda and disinformation in digital news. It identifies propaganda techniques, fact-checks content, and provides explanations. This empowers users to think critically and discern media biases, enhancing democratic integrity.

I am looking forward to working on this with our team: Liudmila Zavolokina, Kilian Sprenkamp, Zoya Katashinskaya, Daniel Gordon Jones and Dorian Quelle.
