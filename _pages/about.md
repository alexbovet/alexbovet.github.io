I am a physicist interested in [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems). In particular,
I am interested in temporal networks, diffusion in networks and the dynamics of social networks. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Belgium at the [Namur Center for Complex Systems](http://www.naxys.be/) of the University of Namur with [Prof. Renaud Lambiotte](http://xn.unamur.be/) and at the [Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics](https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/2107) of the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain with [Prof. Jean-Charles Delvenne](https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/welcome.html).

Before that, I was at the Levich Institute of the City College of New York, USA, with a fellowship of the [SNSF](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/careers/early-postdoc-mobility/Pages/default.aspx) in the lab of [Prof. Hernan Makse](http://www-levich.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/webpage/hmakse/research/), working on the diffusion of information and opinion dynamics in social networks.
I also investigated the spread of diseases in a contact network of a population of wild mice as well as its social and behavioral organization in collaboration with [Prof. Barbara Koenig](http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/behaviour/social) at the Theoretical Biology lab of [Prof. Sebastian Bonhoeffer](http://www.tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=88316) at the [ETHZ](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), Zurich, Switzerland.

I received my PhD in physics from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland, where I was working on the [transport of particles in turbulent](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/205009) [plasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)) with [Prof. Ambrogio Fasoli](https://people.epfl.ch/ambrogio.fasoli) and [Prof. Ivo Furno](https://people.epfl.ch/ivo.furno) as supervisors.
