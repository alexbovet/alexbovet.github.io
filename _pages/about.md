I am a researcher interested in [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems) and in their 
modelling using [complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network).
I am interested in interdisciplinary approaches to answer social and economic questions using tools from 
physics and data science.

In particular, I am interested by the following topics:

- Temporal networks: dynamic community detection, dynamics of social networks
- Information and opinion diffusion: influence of misinformation, mechanism of opinion formation and diffusion
- Data science: clustering algorithms for dynamical data, opinion mining, causality discovery


I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Mathematics of Social Systems and Applications to Public Policy at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford University, in the [Mathematical Data Science group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/data-science) with [Prof. Peter Grindrod](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/peter.grindrod).

Before that, I was a [SNSF Advanced Postdoctoral Fellow](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/careers/postdoc-mobility/Pages/default.aspx) at the [Mathematical Engineering department (INMA, ICTEAM)](https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/2107) of the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain with [Prof. Jean-Charles Delvenne](https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/welcome.html) and at the [Namur Center for Complex Systems](http://www.naxys.be/)/[Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) with [Prof. Renaud Lambiotte](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte) working on temporal networks.
I was also a [SNSF Early Postdoctoral Fellow](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/careers/early-postdoc-mobility/Pages/default.aspx) at the Levich Institute of the City College of New York, USA, with [Prof. Hernan Makse](http://www-levich.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/webpage/hmakse/research/), working on the diffusion of information and opinion dynamics in social networks.
I also investigated the spread of diseases in a contact network of a population of wild mice as well as its social and behavioral organization in collaboration with [Prof. Barbara Koenig](http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/behaviour/social) at the Theoretical Biology lab of [Prof. Sebastian Bonhoeffer](http://www.tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=88316) at the [ETHZ](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), Zurich, Switzerland.

I received my PhD in physics from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland, where I was working on the [transport of particles in turbulent](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/205009) [plasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)) with [Prof. Ambrogio Fasoli](https://people.epfl.ch/ambrogio.fasoli) and [Prof. Ivo Furno](https://people.epfl.ch/ivo.furno) as supervisors.

You can find a list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rbHfk1EAAAAJ&hl=en) and my CV [here](/assets/images/CV_ABovet_online.pdf).
